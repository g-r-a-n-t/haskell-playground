# zk-snarks

This projects works through the 7 components laid out in this [article](https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/) provided by z.cash. 

It's also used as an application for the [algebraic-structures](../algebraic-structures) project in this repo.

Running tests for the following code: `stack test`

## Section 1: "Homomorphic"Hidings

```haskell
-- Homomorphic Hiding
--
-- A homomorphic hiding is the same as a normal group homomorphism, except, the mapping function `E`
-- must be difficult to reverse i.e. given `x` you can compute `E(x)`, but given `E(x)` you can not compute `x`.
newHH _E _G _H = newHomomorphism _E _G _H

-- HH from Zpâˆ’2 to Zxp-1 where p = 11
--
-- Note that this is technically not a group homomorphism as Zp-2 is not a group since it does not include
-- the value 10 i.e. 1 + 9 = 10 /< Zp-2.
-- This value needed to be removed from the group since the order of Zp-1 is 10 since it does not include 0.
zpToZxpByGx = newHH _E _G _H
  where _E x = 2 ^ x -- g = 2
        _G   = newGroup [0..9] (+)
        _H   = newGroup [1..10] (*)
```

## Section 2: BlindEvaluations
```haskell
-- Note: The language in the second part is changed somewhat, where instead of having two
-- groups (Zp and Zxp), we have a single field (Fp). We'll still use the same homomorphism
-- in this section for simplicity.

cs = [2,3,4] -- Alice's polynomial coefficients (2 + 3x + 4x^2)
s =  5       -- Bob's point (5 < Fp)

ws = (cs!!0 + (s * cs!!1) + ((s ^ 2) * cs!!2)) `mod` 11 -- Weighted sum (Neither Bob or Alice should know this value.)
ws' = (_E ws) `mod` 11                                  -- The result of applying E to the weighted sum.
  where Homomorphism _E _ _ = zpToZxpByGx

cs' = map _E cs                                         -- Applying E to each of Alice's coefficients. [E(c1), E(c2),...]
  where Homomorphism _E _ _ = zpToZxpByGx

ar = (foldl (\a (g, x) -> a * (g ^ x)) 1 (zip cs' [s ^ 0, s ^ 1, s ^ 2])) `mod` 11 -- Alice's result (should be equal to ws')
```

## Section 3: KCTest

```haskell
-- Bob's numbers
x = 6 -- x < Fxp (x used in place of alpha and Alice does not know this)
a = 3
b = x * a `mod` 11

-- Alice's numbers
-- She must respond with another x pair.
-- By "x pair" we mean, the second number must be the first value scaled by x.
-- Scaling both numbers provided by Bob with some value y will create another x pair.
y = 2
a' = y * a `mod` 11
b' = y * b `mod` 11

-- Bob not checks if x * a' = b'. This is something that only Bob can do since x is secret. At least I would assume.
-- See spec file.
