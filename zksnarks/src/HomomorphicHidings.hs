-- Homomorphic Hiding
--
-- A homomorphic hiding is the same as a normal group homomorphism, except, the mapping function `E`
-- must be difficult to reverse i.e. given `x` you can compute `E(x)`, but given `E(x)` you can not compute `x`.

-- HH from Zpâˆ’2 to Zxp-1 where p = 11
--
-- Note that this is technically not a group homomorphism as Zp-2 is not a group since it does not include
-- the value 10 i.e. 1 + 9 = 10 /< Zp-2.
-- This value needed to be removed from the group since the order of Zp-1 is 10 since it does not include 0.
