# Grant's Linear Algebra Library

Linear algebra is useful for many things, so I'm making a library to better my understanding of it.

## Supported operations
### Vectors
- addition    `Gla.Vectors.add [1,2] [3,4] --> [3,6]`
- subtraction `Gla.Vectors.subtract [1,2] [3,4] --> [-2,-2]`
- dot product `Gla.Vectors.dot [1,2] [3,4] --> 11`
- scaling     `Gla.Vectors.scale 2 [3,4] --> [6,8]`

### Matrices
- determinant
- mirroring
- multiplication
